title: Wide Area Networks
---
A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a 
large geographic area. Wide area networks are often established with leased 
telecommunication circuits.[1]

## SONET
Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) 
are standardized protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams 
synchronously over optical fiber using lasers or highly coherent light from 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At low transmission rates data can also be 
transferred via an electrical interface. The method was developed to replace 
the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large 
amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without the 
problems of synchronization.

## MPLS
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a routing technique in 
telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based 
on labels rather than network addresses.[1] Whereas network addresses identify 
endpoints, the labels identify established paths between endpoints. MPLS can 
encapsulate packets of various network protocols, hence the multiprotocol 
component of the name. MPLS supports a range of access technologies, including 
T1/E1, ATM, Frame Relay, and DSL.

## SD-WAN
A software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a wide area network that uses 
software-defined networking technology, such as communicating over the Internet 
using overlay tunnels which are encrypted when destined for internal 
organization locations.[1]

## CGNAT
Carrier-grade NAT (CGN or CGNAT), also known as large-scale NAT (LSN), is a 
type of network address translation (NAT) used by ISPs in IPv4 network design. 
With CGNAT, end sites, in particular residential networks, are configured with 
private network addresses that are translated to public IPv4 addresses by 
middlebox network address translator devices embedded in the network operator's 
network, permitting the sharing of small pools of public addresses among many 
end users. This essentially repeats the traditional customer-premise NAT 
function at the ISP level.
