Wi-Fi (/ˈwaɪfaɪ/)[1][a] is a family of wireless network protocols based on the 
IEEE 802.11 family of standards, which are commonly used for local area 
networking of devices and Internet access, allowing nearby digital devices to 
exchange data by radio waves. These are the most widely used computer networks, 
used globally in home and small office networks to link devices and to provide 
Internet access with wireless routers and wireless access points in public 
places such as coffee shops, hotels, libraries, and airports to provide visitors.

## CSMA/CA
Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) in computer 
networking, is a network multiple access method in which carrier sensing is 
used, but nodes attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only 
after the channel is sensed to be "idle". When they do transmit, nodes 
transmit their packet data in its entirety.
